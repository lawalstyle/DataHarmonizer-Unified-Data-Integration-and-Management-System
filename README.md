DataHarmonizer is a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool designed for efficient data integration and management. It automates the process of consolidating, transforming, and loading data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON, XML) into a centralized database, facilitating seamless data analysis and decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Support for CSV, JSON, and XML data formats.
- **Data Transformation**: Robust data cleansing and standardization processes.
- **Data Loading**: Streamlined transfer of processed data into MySQL database.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Adaptable to different data schemas and scalable for growing data needs.
- **User Accessibility**: Simplified for users with various technical backgrounds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MySQL Database
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `mysql-connector-python`

### Installation
